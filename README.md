# Actionable-analytics-predictive-model-metadata
Actionable analytics predictive model metadata created using Force Directed Graph D3
Actionable analytics predictive model metadata is a force directed chart for displaying connected data which has been written in Java script with the d3(data driven document) library. The data and metadata is shown in nodes and sub-nodes. The nodes are connected using links. It has some cool features rolled in. It is a kind of structural layout. This provides an overview of network clusters. A graph's behaviour can be simulated as though it were a physical system after the forces acting on its nodes and edges have been described. In this simulation, the nodes are subjected to forces that push or pull them in different directions.
Features include:
•	Displays flowchart subsets. Given a data-set with 10 nodes, displaying all nodes at once can clutter your screen. With this force directed graph, you can display only a subset of your data-set whilst being able to navigate through the entire data-set with hovering the mouse on the node 
•	None over-lapping labels means that node labels do not obscure each other.
•	The responsive chart resizes upon a browser resize.
•	More features to come up soon ....
Code Instructions:
/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------`
The code example below:
1. Sets the width to 960px.
2. Sets the height to 600px.
3. Sets the font type and font size
4. Creates variable force, color, svg and tooltip
5. Creates a function which Loads the JSON data
6. Creates variable link and node within the function created above and adds the data for node and link variable respectively.
